    "## Introduction\n",
    "[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MindspaceOne** project investigates the effects of combining hypnotherapy and aromatherapy, delivered via a smartphone-based platform, on individuals' ability to achieve targeted states of relaxation or concentration. As modern life grows increasingly stressful, particularly among younger individuals, there is a pressing need for accessible interventions to support mental health and well-being. This project seeks to evaluate whether coupling hypnotherapy with aromatherapy through classical conditioning can enhance the effectiveness of these interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this controlled, randomized experimental pilot study, participants are assigned to one of four groups: (I) Hypnotherapy + Aromatherapy, (II) Hypnotherapy alone, (III) Aromatherapy alone, or (IV) a control group. Over a 4-week period, participants will engage with the assigned treatment daily, followed by a 1-week test phase for conditioning effects in selected groups."

    "## Objective\n",
    "[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this study is to assess whether daily hypnotherapy sessions, with or without aromatherapy, can improve participants' relaxation and concentration as measured by the **Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire (MDBF)** subscales. Secondary objectives include evaluating whether the effects of hypnotherapy can be conditioned to aromatherapy and exploring the influence of other variables such as age, gender, and stress levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "#### Primary Hypothesis (H1):\n",
    "- Hypnotherapy, delivered via a smartphone-based platform, enhances relaxation and concentration, as indicated by improvements on the MDBF subscales (calculated as the change from baseline to the end of the 4-week intervention).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secondary Hypotheses:\n",
    "1. Aromatherapy combined with hypnotherapy enhances the conditioning effect, where aromatherapy alone can trigger the same relaxation or concentration effects as hypnotherapy.\n",
    "2. Exploratory analysis will examine the effects on perceived stress (PSS) and well-being (WHO-5), as well as the moderating role of age, gender, and socioeconomic status.\n"

    "[Back to Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis:** Examine the structure and distribution of data. Identify outliers and assess relationships between variables. Visualize data for key insights.\n",
    "2. **Attrition Analysis:** Assess dropout patterns and identify potential biases due to participant attrition.\n",
    "3. **Compliance Analysis:** Evaluate adherence to the intervention protocols across groups to determine the consistency of treatments.\n",
    "4. **Data Imputation:** Address missing data through multiple imputation techniques, ensuring robust statistical analysis.\n",
    "5. **Model:** Fit a mixed effects model to evaluate changes over time and between groups for primary and secondary outcomes. Test for differences between groups using inferential statistics.\n",
    "6. **Assumptions:** Validate statistical assumptions, including normality of residuals, homogeneity of variances, and absence of significant outliers."

However, this number alone does not accurately reflect the actual amount of missing data in a meaningful way due to the structure of the dataset. Since each individual (Serial_Nr) appears multiple times in the dataset, corresponding to different assessment time points (Quest_Nr), some variables are only relevant at specific time points. As a result, it is expected that certain variables contain missing values at time points where they were not assessed.\n",
    "Additionally, some variables are designed to be recorded only at baseline or follow-up assessments, meaning that missing values in those columns are not necessarily an indication of data loss but rather a natural consequence of the study design. A simple count of missing values across the dataset does not distinguish between these structural missing values, which are expected, and unexpected missing values, which may indicate non-response or data collection issues."

Thus, it offers a robust framework for analyzing sick day counts, ensuring both the overdispersed nature and the zero-heavy distribution of the data are appropriately addressed."

However, the estimated coefficient of -0.0025 is not statistically significant (p = 0.63), and the confidence interval (-0.013 to 0.008) suggests no strong non-linear relationship. Although the quadratic term was not significant, its inclusion ensures that the model accounts for any potential curvature in the relationship between baseline and follow-up sick days.\n",

The intervention's effect is statistically significant, suggesting that it had a beneficial impact on reducing absenteeism due to illness.\n",

    "The diagnostic tests and residual plots provide a comprehensive assessment of the assumptions underlying the negative binomial regression model. First, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test checks whether the residuals are uniformly distributed, which is a key assumption of the model. The test returned a p-value of 0.5745, indicating no significant deviation from a uniform distribution. This suggests that the model fits the data well in terms of uniformity, and there are no substantial issues with how the model captures the overall distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the dispersion test evaluates whether the model is appropriately accounting for the variability in the data—essentially checking for overdispersion or underdispersion. The p-value of 0.344 from this test suggests that the model does not exhibit significant over- or under-dispersion. This indicates that the negative binomial model has successfully handled the variability in the sick day counts, further validating its appropriateness for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier test checks for any extreme values that may unduly influence the model’s fit. The observed outlier frequency was very close to the expected value, with no significant deviations (p-value = 1.0). This implies that there are no problematic outliers affecting the model, confirming that the model adequately captures the data without being skewed by extreme cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visual inspection of the residual plots reinforces these findings. The QQ plot shows that the residuals closely follow the expected distribution, with no significant deviations from the reference line. This further supports the conclusion that the residuals are well-behaved under the model. Similarly, the plot of residuals versus predicted values shows a consistent distribution across the range of predicted values, with no visible patterns or anomalies, suggesting that the model assumptions of homoscedasticity and linearity are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the diagnostic tests and residual plots together confirm that the negative binomial regression model fits the data well. There are no significant issues with uniformity, dispersion, or outliers, indicating that the model is reliable for interpreting the relationship between the intervention and sick days. The results of the model can thus be confidently used for inference, with the model's assumptions holding up under scrutiny."

    "In the first plot, we are looking at the random effects for Cluster_1. The values on the x-axis represent the estimated random effects, and the spread of these values shows the variation between clusters. The random effects range from approximately -0.05 to 0.10, suggesting there is some variability between clusters. However, the variation appears to be quite small, as the random effects are centered close to zero with no extreme deviations. This implies that the Cluster_1 grouping (which may represent different clusters or subgroups within the study) does not contribute much additional variability to the outcome after controlling for the fixed effects in the model. The small magnitude of these random effects suggests that the influence of Cluster_1 is relatively limited.\n",

    "**Interpretation of the Random Effects for kindergarten_ID**\n",

    "In the second plot, we are looking at the random effects for kindergarten_ID, which represent the variability between different kindergartens. The random effects are extremely small, with values clustered around zero, ranging between approximately -5e-09 and 5e-09. This indicates that there is very little variability attributed to individual kindergartens. In practical terms, this suggests that the differences between kindergartens in this study are minimal, and the kindergarten-level grouping does not introduce substantial variation into the model. Like the random effects for Cluster_1, these small random effects for kindergarten_ID indicate that most of the variability in the outcome is likely explained by the fixed effects and not by differences between kindergartens.\n",

This supports the interpretation that most of the outcome variability is captured by the fixed effects rather than these random groupings."

    "This analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of the Kneipp concept on kindergarten children's health, with a specific focus on reducing infection-related absenteeism over a 12-month period. The Kneipp concept, which emphasizes a holistic approach to health through cold water applications, exercise, nutrition, herbs, and life balance, has long been a part of European tradition. However, its specific health benefits for children, particularly in the context of kindergartens, remained largely unexplored prior to this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the analysis, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the dataset, including rigorous data preprocessing and imputation to address missing values. This was followed by an examination of compliance and attrition rates to ensure data integrity. The negative binomial regression model was used to analyze infection-related absenteeism, as it is particularly suited to handling overdispersed count data, such as the number of sick days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assumptions testing revealed that the model met key criteria for validity, with no signs of overdispersion, zero inflation, or problematic residual patterns. This ensured that the negative binomial regression was appropriate for our dataset and that the results could be interpreted with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the analysis indicated that the implementation of the Kneipp concept in kindergartens was associated with a reduction in infection-related absenteeism. The intervention group showed fewer sick days compared to the control group, supporting the hypothesis that the Kneipp approach improves resilience among children by enhancing their ability to avoid illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that the Kneipp concept has the potential to significantly reduce infection-related absenteeism among kindergarten children. These findings suggest that the holistic practices emphasized by the Kneipp concept could be beneficial in promoting health and wellness in educational settings, contributing to better overall outcomes for children. This provides a strong foundation for further research into the benefits of such integrative health interventions in early childhood education."
